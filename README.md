# Fork
This project is a fork of [Infinity for Reddit](https://github.com/Docile-Alligator/Infinity-For-Reddit).

One major enhancement is that it lets you set your own `Client ID` as a setting. This means you don't need to recompile it, or to
use [Revanced Manager](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-manager).

# Setup
See [SETUP.md](/SETUP.md)

# Updates
See [UPDATES.md](/UPDATES.md)
